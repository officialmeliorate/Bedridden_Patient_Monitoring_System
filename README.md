Bedridden Patient Monitoring System monitors the live health conditions such as heart rate, dissolved oxygen level in blood etc and provides the live result in mobile phones through Blynk cloud.
The bedridden patient can convert their gesture into speech through this project. Here we are implemented three basic messages:
"I Need water!","I Need Food!"and "Emergency! Please Come Here". 
Through the gesture of patient, our system will identify these instructions and display the message as notification on the Blynk application and also send email regarding the message on the email provided.
